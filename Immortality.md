# Immortality

* Write an A to time travel, and an A to become immortal and <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Text-to-Breasonings">breason it out</a>.

* Before using `texttobr2_1(1).` to time travel to October 1 5698, read:

  * Before running texttobr, think of two radio buttons put on recordings, put through with prayer, nut and bolt, quantum box prayer 1, 1, 0.5 cm and 1, 1, 0.5 cm.

  * Follow instructions in <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Text-to-Breasonings/blob/master/Instructions_for_Using_texttobr(2).pl.txt">Instructions for Using texttobr(2)</a> when using texttobr, texttobr2 or mind reader to avoid medical problems.

  * The <a href="https://www.lucianacademy.com/apps/preventheadaches.html">Prevent Headaches App</a> may be necessary.

* Read <a href="https://www.lucianacademy.com/files/Philosophy/LucianGreensPhilosophyAugust2021/Immortality.txt">Immortality entry 1</a> for instructions on how to enter the simulation to be immortal.  ("Work.. out with 250 breasonings that buying the sim card to my time represented buying the simulation chip - `texttobr2_1(1).`.  Turn... it on - `texttobr2_1(1).`). You can indicate to become immortal.

* There are text-to-breasonings supported window periods in the future.  For example, it is recommended to repeatedly visit the time October 1-16 5698, time travelling back to the start of this time every 16 days, otherwise a non-text-to-breasonings supported time may cause medical problems.

* You need to visit a future time that supports Immortality each day to activate Immortality.

* Switch for <a href="https://www.lucianacademy.com/files/Philosophy/LucianGreensPhilosophyOctober2021/Immortality%20Medicine.txt">Immortality medicine</a> to stop dementia, have clear sight, think clearly, etc. each month in Immortality.  Use <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Algorithm-Writer-with-Lists">Grammar-Logic</a> to generate 4000 word breasonings for a department, for example Education, generate 4000 word breasonings for B (disagreement with) Education and 4000 word breasonings for B to B to (solve disagreements with) Education, then <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Text-to-Object-Name">hand-breason</a> them out.  Note: just for these arguments, please avoid using <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Text-to-Breasonings">Text-to-Breasonings</a> to avoid, for example haemmhorrhoids.

* <a href="https://www.lucianacademy.com/files/Philosophy/LucianGreensPhilosophyOctober2021/50%20Bs%20to%20medical%20problems%20in%20immortality.txt">Switch to turn off medical problems</a> once from each department you have been developed about to activate Immortality.  Use <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Algorithm-Writer-with-Lists">Grammar-Logic</a> to generate 4000 word breasonings from the list of body systems, generate 4000 word breasonings for B (problems with) body systems and 4000 word breasonings for B to B to (solve problems with) body systems, then use <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Text-to-Breasonings">Text-to-Breasonings</a> to breason them out. 

* The custodians, the robots, require residents to think of an English (autobiographical) statement to be thought of per day.

* As an aside, <a href="https://www.lucianacademy.com/files/Philosophy/LucianGreensPhilosophySeptember2021/seminar%20in%20all%20depts%20every%202%20weeks.txt">watch videos from University departments every week</a> (with 50 As each, breasoned out with <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Text-to-Breasonings">Text to Breasonings</a>) for professional development.
