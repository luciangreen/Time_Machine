# Time_Machine

* Warning: Changing the algorithm to not include meditation may be fatal.
* Travel through time with meditation.

* "I can convert myself to a bot, convert shadow bots to bots (allowing people and finance) and time travel as a bot (all with 250 breasonings).  There is a lag while people are ready for you to time travel."

# Prerequisites

* Please download and install SWI-Prolog for your machine at `https://www.swi-prolog.org/build/`.

# 1. Install manually

Download <a href="http://github.com/luciangreen/Time_Machine/">this repository</a>, <a href="http://github.com/luciangreen/listprologinterpreter/">List Prolog Interpreter</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Text-to-Breasonings">Text-to-Breasonings repository</a>.

# 2. Or Install from List Prolog Package Manager (LPPM)

* Download the <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/List-Prolog-Package-Manager">LPPM Repository</a>:

```
git clone https://github.com/luciangreen/List-Prolog-Package-Manager.git
cd List-Prolog-Package-Manager
swipl
['lppm'].
lppm_install("luciangreen","Time_Machine")
halt
```

# Caution:

* Before running texttobr, think of two radio buttons put on recordings, put through with prayer, nut and bolt, quantum box prayer 1, 1, 0.5 cm and 1, 1, 0.5 cm.

* Follow instructions in <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Text-to-Breasonings/blob/master/Instructions_for_Using_texttobr(2).pl.txt">Instructions for Using texttobr(2)</a> when using texttobr, texttobr2 or mind reader to avoid medical problems.

# Running

* In Shell:

`swipl`
`['time_machine.pl'].`
`time_machine.`

```
[debug]  ?- time(time_machine).
Time Machine

Warning: This software is to be used at your own risk.  Please read the Instructions for TextToBr to avoid medical problems before use.

This time machine will transport you and named friends to a place and time and back before a specified time.  You may come back before the given time with the thought command, "I want to time travel back to the same place in my own time line, the same amount of time relative to when I left".

Please wear clothes appropriate for the time and determine whether it is a good time to travel, especially in the past and using predictions of the future.
