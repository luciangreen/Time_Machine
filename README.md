# Time_Machine

* Summary: To become immortal, you can dot on the co-op’s planned 16k (sentence) breasonings for meditation and 16k breasonings for anti-ageing medicine for the day in your home time each day without time travelling with two radio buttons (1 by 1 by 0.5 cm for a radio button). Don’t forget to lock off ageing (to other people) and lock off this lock being tampered with further 16k breasonings for each lock. The locks are done once. Tell others about this repository or dot the breasonings on for them each day with their consent to help them become immortal.

* You will need 1000 pedagogy breasonings for text to breasonings for enough breasonings per breasoning session, 80 meditation breasonings, 80 medicine breasonings for anti-ageing, 80 time travel breasonings, 80 mind reading breasonings, 80 time crystal breasonings, 80 breasonings for having a spiritual future apartment and 80 breasonings for having a spiritual future computer, indicated in the present and the correct set of dates in 5689 each day after joining the simulation for immortality without a laptop with power supply. Otherwise, you can run the algorithm in this repository.
* Welcome to Lucian's Time Machine, which offers a positive way of life, extending life for those who would like it and bringing advanced technology to us so that all may enjoy immortality through meditation.
* The way of life in the simulation is relaxing; there is no pressure to work, and one can live on a pension, creating art, studying and having fun.
* Imagine the possibilities: articulating to the top of academia and industry, enjoying the perks of relaxation from activity and preventing the onset of age-related body breakdown.  

* Warning: Changing the algorithm not to include meditation may be fatal.  You should meditate with 108 arems and 108 friendlinesses before and after travel.
* Please utter arem and friendliness instead of lucian and green.
* Travel through time with meditation.

* "I can convert myself to a bot, convert shadow bots to bots (allowing people and finance) and time travel as a bot (all with 250 breasonings).  There is a lag while people are ready for you to time travel."

# Prerequisites

* Use a search engine to find the Homebrew (or other) Terminal install command for your platform and install it, and search for the Terminal command to install swipl using Homebrew and install it or download and install SWI-Prolog for your machine at  <a href="https://www.swi-prolog.org/build/">SWI-Prolog</a>.

# Mac, Linux and Windows (with Linux commands installed): Prepare to run swipl

* In Terminal settings (Mac), make Bash the default shell:

```
/bin/bash
```

* In Terminal, edit the text file `~/.bashrc` using the text editor Nano:

```
nano ~/.bashrc
```

* Add the following to the file `~/.bashrc`:

```
export PATH="$PATH:/opt/homebrew/bin/"
```

* Check if `usr/local/bin` exists

```
ls -ld /usr/local/bin
```

* Create the directory if missing

```
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
```

* Link to swipl in Terminal

```
sudo ln -s /opt/homebrew/bin/swipl /usr/local/bin/swipl
```

# 1. Install manually

Download <a href="http://github.com/luciangreen/Time_Machine/">this repository</a>, <a href="http://github.com/luciangreen/Lucian-Academy/">Lucian-Academy</a>, <a href="http://github.com/luciangreen/listprologinterpreter/">List Prolog Interpreter</a>,  the <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Text-to-Breasonings">Text-to-Breasonings repository</a> and the repositories these repositories depend on.

# 2. Or Install from List Prolog Package Manager (LPPM)

* Download the <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/List-Prolog-Package-Manager">LPPM Repository</a>:
* Installing Time Machine takes 2 minutes and running the Immortality Script takes 33 minutes.

```
mkdir GitHub
cd GitHub/
git clone https://github.com/luciangreen/List-Prolog-Package-Manager.git
cd List-Prolog-Package-Manager
swipl
['lppm'].
lppm_install("luciangreen","Time_Machine").
../
halt.
```

* Next: <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Time_Machine/blob/main/Immortality_Script.md">Immortality Script</a> to install and effect Immortality. You can then join the Simulation and become Immortal!

# Caution:

* Before running texttobr, think of two radio buttons put on recordings, put through with prayer, nut and bolt, quantum box prayer 1, 1, 0.5 cm and 1, 1, 0.5 cm.

* Follow instructions in <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Text-to-Breasonings/blob/master/Instructions_for_Using_texttobr(2).pl.txt">Instructions for Using texttobr(2)</a> when using texttobr, texttobr2 or mind reader to avoid medical problems.

* The <a href="Prevent-Headaches.md">Prevent Headaches App</a> may be necessary.

* <a href="Immortality.md">Instructions on becoming immortal</a>

* The <a href="Caveats.md">Immortality Caveats</a> describe ways to enter immortality and more about the simulation.

* Running Time Machine requires the Text to Breasonings algorithm, which requires:
- Meditation before running the algorithm and after arriving at a time travel destination.
- Understanding of the Pedagogy (breasoning) skill, activated by a University short course in Education.
- Recordings skill, which is activated by a person who has this skill after breasoning out a Recordings High Distinction.
- <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Text-to-Breasonings/blob/master/Instructions_for_Using_texttobr(2).pl.txt">Other requirements</a>, including the Lecturer skill
- The window (ability) to time travel may disappear soon after learning the time travel skill, so it is advisable to travel to the time in <a href="Immortality.md">Instructions on becoming immortal</a> to gain a permanent time travel skill.
- Time travel and immortality have no course or other prerequisites. The algorithm contains them but you don't have to do anything.

# How to Maintain Immortality

* <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Time_Machine">Time Machine on GitHub</a>, particularly the Immortality Script to become immortal.
* <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Time_Machine/blob/main/big_medit1.md">Daily Big Meditation 1 Script for Time Travel and Body Replacement</a>.
* The alternative to the Big Meditation 1 Script is the following. Note 108 utterances may require realistic time travel to a University Transcendental Meditation course. NB. Breasonings are words given by x, y and z dimensions, and 16,000 words come from everyday algorithms in natural language, for example, from my Lucian Academy books. Read these in the Lucian Academy/Books repository. Once you read or understand that they can be read, indicate them with a prayer or indicate them with 10 breasoned out words. NB. One hundred and eight utterances, representing 16,000 breasonings in each of the following, should contain at least three utterances or breasonings (an example of a breasoning is a 0.01 cm wide, 0.01 cm deep and 0.005 cm high plastic button) before the rest are indicated. Instructions: Repeat 108 arems, 108 friendlinesses (or just three of each of these utterances or three breasonings), 16,000 breasonings (or 10 breasonings), 108 arems and 108 friendlinesses for each step in (15 by 16k breasonings (say the word “fifteen”) for an apartment in the time (16k), body systems (11*16k), body replacement, meditation, time travel, meditation) in the (present and one of 1-16/10/5698 in the future, one day at a time) followed by body replacement each day.

# How to cure disease

* Cure disease with <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Time_Machine/blob/main/bc12.md">bc12.pl</a>.

# Running

* In Shell:
`cd Time_Machine`
`swipl` or possibly `swipl --stack-limit=4G` if more memory is needed
`['time_machine.pl'].`
`time_machine_prepare.` to breason out necessary courses for time travel including:
- Delegate workloads, Lecturer, Recordings
- Fundamentals of Meditation and Meditation Indicators
- Fundamentals of Pedagogy and Pedagogy Indicators
- Lecturer
- Medicine
- Mind Reading
- Time Travel

* DANGER: Time Travelling without Mind Reading can be fatal because you, the bot, need to sense obstacles, vehicles, people and dangers that you can't see.

* To time travel: `texttobr2_1(3).` with radiation switched off gives "appearance time travel".  This means people from the times will walk past you wearing clothes and surrounded by the setting of your current time.  Your computer will work and you can go home and recharge it to time travel to your home again.  A bot representing you will appear at home while you are time travelling and bots representing those from your home will appear to you while you are time travelling.
* Using `texttobr2_1(3).` not `texttobr2_1(1).` indicates A, B (catching blocks to travel) and B to B (objecting to blocks to travel).

# Immortality Installation Frequently Asked Questions

* Do I need prerequisites? No, install SWI-Prolog, Time Machine and run the Immortality Script.

* (For worrywarts:) Do I need to learn or practise Transcendental or any other type of meditation? No, the script takes care of it all.

* Pedagogy is automatically completed by "Text to Breasonings". Do I need to know anything about Pedagogy? No. It's on autopilot. Research my <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Lucian-Academy">Lucian Academy repository</a> to find out how Pedagogy and Text to Breasonings can provide a valuable tool for examining life in immortality.

* Do I need to prepare for Text to Breasonings? No, preparation for Text to Breasonings is part of the script.

* Will I feel different when time-travelling? Everything is the same; it's just the sensationless script and meeting new people outside. They'll think you're from their time.

* Does becoming immortal feel different? No, it feels refreshing and is permanent. I recommend things like having a good diet, meditating if that helps you to feel healthy and doing a <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Time_Machine/blob/main/big_medit1.md">body replacement</a> once daily with my software. Pedagogy enables you to feel like you control the spaceship.

* How can I control the spaceship? Once written and touched up with the ways of thinking, pedagogy can be indicated spiritually. It's okay if you have never started or if you never start. Some people indicate the "16000 breasonings" necessary to manifest breasonings, time travel and body replacement, etc., with three breasonings for meditation and three breasonings for the 16000 breasonings.

* What else can I switch on with 16000 breasonings? <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Text-to-Breasonings/">earn high distinctions, support but not conceive healthy children, earn jobs, sell products, produce quantum energy and gravity, project simulations, read objects, create quantum computers, prevent headaches and perform spiritual surgery, replicate or vaporise items such as spiritual food or supplements, read minds, display spiritual screens, time travel or become immortal</a>. 16000 breasonings are preferred to other numbers of breasonings because they are agreed to achieve the result correctly. You can order a spiritual robot dog, control a computer (which will reset if you program one line incorrectly), do more complicated, realistic time-travelling, use your room as a spaceship to another planet for the day and back, change your appearance, or change or temporarily leave simulations. Read more about <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Text-to-Breasonings/blob/master/lucian_s_pedagogy.txt">Lucian's Pedagogy</a>.

* I have so many more questions. What is the simulation like? What is it like to program in the future? Do human animals, robots, aliens, and holograms look like other humans? If it's all based on my neighbourhood, can I decide I've come home? They are all answered inside.

* I am not "au fait" with Installation in Shell, Prolog and Terminal. Everything you need to know is included in the instructions (and they are seamless, and I can be contacted for help at <a href="mailto:luciangreen@lucianacademy.com">luciangreen@lucianacademy.com</a>). Remember, it's as simple as 1. Installing SWI-Prolog, 2. Time Machine, 3. The Immortality Script.

* Is my faith or spiritual practice compatible with this? Most faiths include immortality, so this would be acceptable and fun as part of your faith or practice.
