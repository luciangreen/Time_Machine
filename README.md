# Time_Machine

* Warning: Changing the algorithm to not include meditation may be fatal.  You should meditate with 108 arems before and after travel.
* Warning: Time travel and immortality may move your life to the simulation, differing from it in the world.  Read <a href="Immortality.md">Instructions on becoming immortal</a>.  However, "Even though I think people think I died, they don't - I appear alive but keep my youth to myself".
* Travel through time with meditation.
* <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YojBn1UcFKo&t=14s">Youtube video</a>
* "I can convert myself to a bot, convert shadow bots to bots (allowing people and finance) and time travel as a bot (all with 250 breasonings).  There is a lag while people are ready for you to time travel."

# Prerequisites

* Please download and install SWI-Prolog for your machine at `https://www.swi-prolog.org/build/`.

# 1. Install manually

Download <a href="http://github.com/luciangreen/Time_Machine/">this repository</a>, <a href="http://github.com/luciangreen/Lucian-Academy/">Lucian-Academy</a>, <a href="http://github.com/luciangreen/listprologinterpreter/">List Prolog Interpreter</a>,  the <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Text-to-Breasonings">Text-to-Breasonings repository</a> and the repositories these repositories depend on.

# 2. Or Install from List Prolog Package Manager (LPPM)

* Download the <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/List-Prolog-Package-Manager">LPPM Repository</a>:

```
git clone https://github.com/luciangreen/List-Prolog-Package-Manager.git
cd List-Prolog-Package-Manager
swipl
['lppm'].
lppm_install("luciangreen","Time_Machine").
halt
```

# Caution:

* Before running texttobr, think of two radio buttons put on recordings, put through with prayer, nut and bolt, quantum box prayer 1, 1, 0.5 cm and 1, 1, 0.5 cm.

* Follow instructions in <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Text-to-Breasonings/blob/master/Instructions_for_Using_texttobr(2).pl.txt">Instructions for Using texttobr(2)</a> when using texttobr, texttobr2 or mind reader to avoid medical problems.

* The <a href="Prevent-Headaches.md">Prevent Headaches App</a> may be necessary.

* <a href="Immortality.md">Instructions on becoming immortal</a>

* Running Time Machine requires the Text to Breasonings algorithm, which requires:
- Meditation before running the algorithm and after arriving at a time travel destination.
- Understanding of the Pedagogy (breasoning) skill, activated by a University short course in Education.
- Recordings skill, which is activated by a person who has this skill after breasoning out a Recordings High Distinction.
- <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Text-to-Breasonings/blob/master/Instructions_for_Using_texttobr(2).pl.txt">Other requirements</a>, including the Lecturer skill
- The window (ability) to time travel may disappear soon after learning the time travel skill, so it is advisable to travel to the time in <a href="Immortality.md">Instructions on becoming immortal</a> to gain a permanent time travel skill.
- The courses above required for time travel are included in the algorithm below (so they may not be required apart from the High Distinction texts in the algorithm).

# Running

* In Shell:
`cd Time_Machine`
`swipl` or possibly `swipl --stack-limit=4G` if more memory is needed
`['time_machine.pl'].`
`time_machine_prepare.` to breason out necessary courses for time travel including:
- Delegate workloads, Lecturer, Recordings
- Fundamentals of Meditation and Meditation Indicators
- Fundamentals of Pedagogy and Pedagogy Indicators
- Lecturer
- Medicine
- Mind Reading
- Time Travel

* To time travel: `texttobr2_1(3).` with radiation switched off gives "appearance time travel".  This means people from the times will walk past you wearing clothes and surrounded by the setting of your current time.  Your computer will work and you can go home and recharge it to time travel to your home again.  A bot representing you will appear at home while you are time travelling and bots representing those from your home will appear to you while you are time travelling.
* Using `texttobr2_1(3).` not `texttobr2_1(1).` indicates A, B (catching blocks to travel) and B to B (objecting to blocks to travel).
