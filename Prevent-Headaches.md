# Prevent Headaches

* Introduction
* What is this?
Use the Prevent Headaches App to help prevent stress (non-pathological) headaches. It combines meditation with a non-invasive spiritual medical technique and a daily regimen. Because stress headaches can start in the body, it is recommended to use our muscle aches and pain preventative technique. This app can help prevent headaches in post-Honours University students, on trains, in cars, and in the sun. Please stay out of the sun in high-UV hours and do yoga before long train journeys.
* Meditation
You can naturally prevent a headache by silently repeating the mantra, "arem" for twenty, minutes, twice per day. The mantra becomes lighter and lighter, until one forgets the thought, clearing the mind.  Also, silently repeat the sutra "green" for twenty minutes, twice per day after two months of using the mantra in the morning and evening.  Also, pray for no digestive system pops from practising the sutra each day.
* Quantum Box and Nut and Bolt
* Quantum Box
The quantum box is a guided meditation that I will describe later that prevents headaches, (relaxes head and neck muscles), and prevents muscle aches and pains.  In it, you can make anything (e.g. a headache) instantly disappear, based on quantum physics (where at the quantum level, things may disappear if we want them to). 
* Nut and Bolt
The nut and bolt is a guided meditation that is a more detailed prevention of problems the Quantum Box prevents.  In it, pretend to unscrew a nut from a long thin bolt each day to prevent a headache, etc.
* Daily Regimen
Indicate 2 radio buttons (one for each of the following ideas, and one for each of these ideas working anyway, where a radio button is indicated by breasoning out, or thinking of the x, y and z dimensions of a counter, 0.01, 0.01, 0.005 metres).

* Prevention Technique
If you feel a headache coming on, then think, "I don't want nothing to happen, followed by a headache.  This idea works at the time.  Each of the other parts have been taken care of.  Green, Doctor."
