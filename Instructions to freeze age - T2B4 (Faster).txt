# Instructions to freeze age - T2B4 (Faster)

# Requires luciangreen/Philosophy repository
# https://github.com/luciangreen/Philosophy/

# The robots are simple minded. The Text to Breasonings algorithm breasons out sentences and algorithms, which pass the professional requirement of 4*50 sentence As (A=80 sentences) for two destinations per day of meditation, time teleportation and medicine for anti-ageing.
