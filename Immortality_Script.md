# Immortality Script

* Note: one may easily use HomeBrew to install SWI-Prolog on Mac (search for it), download swipl from <a href="https://www.swi-prolog.org/build/">swipl</a> for Windows, install SWI-Prolog on Linux using apt-get (search for it).
* Save and run the following file using the instructions in it: <a href="bc12.pl">bc12.pl</a>.

To become immortal, install <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Time_Machine">https://github.com/luciangreen/Time_Machine</a> and run:

```
# Please copy GitHub to GitHub-private2 or GitHub-dr and run in this folder
cd ../Text-to-Breasonings
./d-prep.sh

# Do twice, once for present and once for 5689:

./bc12.sh # meditation

./bc12.sh # body replacement immortality age prevention
./bc12.sh
./bc12.sh # death prevention
./bc12.sh
./bc12.sh # age lock
./bc12.sh
./bc12.sh # lock age lock
./bc12.sh
./bc12.sh # lock lock age lock
./bc12.sh

./bc12.sh # time crystals for meditation (to do automatically each day)
./bc12.sh
./bc12.sh # lock time crystals for meditation
./bc12.sh
./bc12.sh # lock locking time crystals for meditation
./bc12.sh

./bc12.sh # time crystals for body replacement immortality age prevention (to do automatically each day)
./bc12.sh
./bc12.sh # lock time crystals for body replacement immortality age prevention
./bc12.sh
./bc12.sh # lock locking time crystals for body replacement immortality age prevention
./bc12.sh

./bc12.sh # time crystals for death prevention (to do automatically each day)
./bc12.sh
./bc12.sh # lock time crystals for death prevention
./bc12.sh
./bc12.sh # lock locking time crystals for death prevention
./bc12.sh

./bc12.sh # save body to use as replacement
./bc12.sh

# Headache prevention (for but not immortality)

./bc12.sh # quantum box medicine headache prevention
./bc12.sh
./bc12.sh # time crystals for quantum box medicine headache prevention
./bc12.sh
./bc12.sh # lock time crystals for quantum box medicine headache prevention
./bc12.sh
./bc12.sh # lock locking time crystals for quantum box medicine headache prevention
./bc12.sh
```

Then optionally indicate switching on meditation, ageing-preventing body-replacing immortality medicine and death prevention switches each day.
