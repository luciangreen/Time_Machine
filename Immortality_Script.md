# Immortality Script

* Note: one may easily use HomeBrew to install SWI-Prolog on Mac (search for it), download swipl from <a href="https://www.swi-prolog.org/build/">swipl</a> for Windows or install SWI-Prolog on Linux using apt-get (search for it).
* See <a href="troubleshooting.md">Troubleshooting</a> for help.
* To become immortal, install <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Time_Machine">https://github.com/luciangreen/Time_Machine</a> and run:
