# Instructions to freeze age

# Requires luciangreen/Philosophy repository

# The robots are simple minded. The BAG algorithm produces sentences and mock algorithms, which pass the professional requirement of 4*50 sentence As (A=80 sentences) for two destinations per day of 3 time teleportations and 2 medicines for anti-ageing.

# Replace fourth strings in Lucian-Academy/Books1/algs/lgalgs_a.txt and Lucian-Academy/Books1/args/lgtext_a.txt with the Philosophy algorithms and Lucian Academy books, respectively, deleting double quotes and backslashes.

### Perhaps delete sparse (data-like) sections of Lucian-Academy/Books1/algs/lgalgs_a.txt and Lucian-Academy/Books1/args/lgtext_a.txt
