# The robots are simple minded. The BAG algorithm produces sentences and mock algorithms, which pass the professional requirement of 4*50 sentence As (A=80 sentences) for two destinations per day of 2 meditations, 2 time teleportations and 2 medicines for anti-ageing.

# Optionally run on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) (See https://github.com/luciangreen/Text-to-Breasonings/blob/master/Setting_up_a_VPS_with_TextToBr.txt).

# So, 64,000 argument and algorithm breasonings per destination (of meditation, time teleportation and medicine for anti-ageing, must have home and October 5689 and wait for the breasonings to finish to take effect in each destination). I prefer to run the 64,000 breasonings for a third time after returning to 5689, as this is a new leg of the journey.
