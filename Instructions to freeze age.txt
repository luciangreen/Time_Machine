Instructions to freeze age

Requires luciangreen/Philosophy repository
https://github.com/luciangreen/Philosophy/

The robots are simple minded. The BAG algorithm produces sentences and mock algorithms, which pass the professional requirement of 4*50 sentence As (A=80 sentences) for two destinations per day of 3 time teleportations and 2 medicines for anti-ageing.

Replace fourth strings in Lucian-Academy/Books1/algs/lgalgs_a.txt and Lucian-Academy/Books1/args/lgtext_a.txt with the Philosophy algorithms and Lucian Academy books, respectively, deleting double quotes and backslashes.


In Philosophy:

Run swipl with flags:
swipl --stack-limit=80G

['bag_args2.pl'].
bag_args(80000).
halt.

['bag_algs.pl'].
bag_algs(80000).
halt.


In Text-to-Breasonings:

Breason out a red square as the seen-as version of the following breasonings.

texttobr2(u,u,"square.",u).

Remove "1. \n" and replace "\n\n" with "\n" until none left from these files.

Breason and t2ab these files out by dragging their contents into Text-to-Breasonings/file.txt in BBEdit (Mac).

N=1,M=u,texttobr2(N,"file.txt",u,M,false,false,false,false,false,false,0,[auto,on]).


In t2ab:

N=1,M=u,t2ab(N,"file.txt",u,M,on).

* Remember to do this each day before time travelling, and indicate anti-ageing medicine at each time travelled to.
