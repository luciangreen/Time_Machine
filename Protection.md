# Additional Protection from Dying

* Immortal people can be protected by giving them 4*50 As of high quality thoughts at the start of a period (or once per day).
* The 4*50 As are Breasoning Algorithm Generator (BAG) (sentence) As, completed with <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Time_Machine/blob/main/Instructions%20to%20freeze%20age.txt">freezing age As</a> or <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Time_Machine/blob/main/Instructions%20to%20freeze%20age%20-%20T2B4%20(Faster).txt">freezing age As (faster) (Note 1)</a>.
* Note 1: Run ./d.sh in Freezing Age As (Faster) (above) daily to earn sentience in the simulation (have one's own living quarters and appearance) by preparing for 15 simulants.
