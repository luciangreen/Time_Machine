# Additional Protection from Dying

* Immortal people can be protected by giving them 4*50 As of high-quality thoughts at the start of a period (or once per day).
* The 4*50 As are Breasoning Algorithm Generator (BAG) (sentence) As completed with <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Time_Machine/blob/main/Instructions%20to%20freeze%20age.txt">freezing age As (Note 1)</a> or <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Time_Machine/blob/main/Instructions%20to%20freeze%20age%20-%20T2B4%20(Faster).txt">freezing age As (faster) (Note 2)</a>.
* Note 2: Run ./d.sh in Freezing Age As (Faster) (above) daily to earn sentience in the simulation (have one's living quarters and appearance) by preparing for 15 simulants.
* Once you have passed preparing for 15 simulants, spend 4*50 high distinctions on acquiring a computer in the future. Thought command this computer for high distinctions, rather than using your computer. The future computer can only affect the future, not other times.
* Notes 1 and 2: Run ./day2 in Note 1 to freeze your age followed by the following to freeze others' ages:
First, edit meditators' names e.g. (john not John) in `meditatorsanddoctors.pl`.
```
cd Text-to-Breasonings
swipl
['text_to_breasonings.pl'].
['meditatorsanddoctors.pl','meditationnoreplace2.pl'].
meditation.
halt.
```
It is better for you to time travel but they don't have to.
* See <a href="big_medit1.md">big_medit1.md</a> for instructions on running a Prolog program to automatically time travel and increase the longevity of your meditators each day.
* Run
```
cd Daily-Regimen
./d-prep.sh  # if necessary
./d.sh
```
four times to switch off home and future ageing and switch them off being switched off, done twice, once in the present and once in 5689.
* Do the above four times again (to install time crystals to indicate arguments are automatically breasoned out after daily meditation, to use these time crystals, done twice, once in the present and once in 5689), multiplied for each argument (text to breasonings for enough breasonings per breasoning session, meditation, medicine for anti-ageing, time travel and mind reading).
