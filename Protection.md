# Additional Protection from Dying

* Disclaimer: This technique may not work.

* Immortal people and animals can be protected from "accepting dying" to others from, for example a medical problem, accident or natural disaster by giving them 4*50 As of high quality thoughts at the start of a period (or once per day) to negate the appearance of dying and remain alive to those around them.
* Otherwise, with only being a member of the simulation and having age freezing, meditation and time travel As, they are borderline candidates for dying.
* The 4*50 As are Breasoning Algorithm Generator (BAG) (sentence) As, completed with <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Time_Machine/blob/main/Instructions%20to%20freeze%20age.txt">freezing age As</a>.
