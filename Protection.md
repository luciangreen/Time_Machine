# Additional Protection from Dying

* Immortal people can be protected by giving them 4*50 As of high-quality thoughts at the start of a period (or once per day).
* The 4*50 As are Breasoning Algorithm Generator (BAG) (sentence) As completed with <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Time_Machine/blob/main/Instructions%20to%20freeze%20age.txt">freezing age As (Note 1)</a> or <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Time_Machine/blob/main/Instructions%20to%20freeze%20age%20-%20T2B4%20(Faster).txt">freezing age As (faster) (Note 2)</a>.
* Note 2: Run ./d.sh in Freezing Age As (Faster) (above) daily to earn sentience in the simulation (have one's living quarters and appearance) by preparing for 15 simulants.
* Once you have passed preparing for 15 simulants, spend 4*50 high distinctions on acquiring a computer in the future. Thought command this computer for high distinctions, rather than using your computer. The future computer can only affect the future, not other times.
* Notes 1 and 2: Run ./day2 in Note 1 to freeze your age and ./b00.sh in Note 2 to freeze others' ages.
