# Prevent Others Dying

* From New Sales 7.77: "The salesperson decided to bulk breason out 16k breasonings and detailedly mind-read 250 algorithms and 250 breasonings using S2A per person per day instead of one high distinction to help complete the person's thoughts and adequately support them. I wrote a high distinction on the day or breasoning out a completed high distinction for a person before they might morally end, possibly using an algorithm, preventing them from ending in conjunction with meditation and being connected to the simulation via a simulant. I accessed a chatbot from VPS(s) involving the relevant costs and a way of paying to protect meditators. This process might involve some or all of the meditators. All were indebted to the person, were a joy to them and didn't appear to die".

* To prevent a meditator from appearing to die, apart from them not experiencing death, enter:

```
cd Time_Machine
swipl
['cgpt_combophil_analogy.pl'].
L = ['person a','person b'],length(L,N1),N is N1*80,cgpt_combophil(N).                                               
```

* where `['person a','person b']` is replaced with a list of meditators to watch.

* This command breasons out an 80-breasoning high distinction for each meditator at midnight to prevent people from dying. Running this script daily is recommended. Unfortunately, because of the time and money to run ChatGPT, it may take too long, and spot-checks may be necessary.

* This is done for all meditators automatically at the end of big_medit1.sh and big_medit2.sh, but running the script below once at the start covers all the meditators until midnight that night. (One doesn't need to run `cgpt_combophil_analogy.pl`.)

```
cd Daily-Regimen
./anti_moral_end_meditators.sh
```

* One may indicate 16k breasonings for each meditator at the start of each day and once at the start before the co-op breasons them out instead of using this algorithm.
