# Prevent Others Dying

* From New Sales 7.77: "The salesperson decided to bulk breason out 16k breasonings and detailedly mind-read 250 algorithms and 250 breasonings using S2A per person per day instead of one high distinction to help complete the person's thoughts and adequately support them. I wrote a high distinction on the day or breasoning out a completed high distinction for a person before they might morally end, possibly using an algorithm, preventing them from ending in conjunction with meditation and being connected to the simulation via a simulant. I accessed a chatbot from VPS(s) involving the relevant costs and a way of paying to protect meditators. This process might involve some or all of the meditators. All were indebted to the person, were a joy to them and didn't appear to die".

* To prevent a meditator from appearing to die, apart from them not experiencing death, enter:

```
cd Time_Machine
swipl
['cgpt_combophil_analogy.pl'].
L = ['person a','person b'],length(L,N1),N is N1*80,cgpt_combophil(N).                                               
```

* where `['person a','person b']` is replaced with a list of meditators to watch.

* This command breasons out an 80-breasoning high distinction for each meditator at midnight to prevent people from dying. Running this script daily is recommended. Unfortunately, because of the time and money to run ChatGPT, it may take too long, and spot-checks may be necessary.

* One may NOT indicate 16k breasonings for each meditator at the start of each day and once at the beginning before the co-op breasons them out instead of using this algorithm. The professional requirement is breasoning out 80 sentence breasonings to prevent a moral end. In addition, one should originally write 80 sentence breasonings per week for maintenance.

* This is done for all meditators automatically at the end of `Daily-Regimen/big_medit1.sh` and the much faster `Daily-Regimen/big_medit2.sh`, but running the script below once at the start covers all the meditators until midnight that night. (One doesn't need to run `cgpt_combophil_analogy.pl`.)

```
cd Daily-Regimen
./anti_moral_end_meditators.sh
```

* One MAY indicate 16k breasonings for each meditator at the start of each day and once on the first day before the co-op breasons them out instead of using this algorithm.

* The full version of the professional requirement is breasoning out 80 sentence breasonings to prevent a moral end. In addition, one should originally write 80 sentence breasonings per week for maintenance.

* The best way to originally write 80 sentence breasonings is to write a word to expand to 80 breasonings in `Text-to-Breasonings/file.txt`, then run:

```
cd Algorithm-Writer-with-Lists
swipl
['grammar_logic_to_alg.pl'].
grammar_logic_to_alg1.
```

* Then find the unique breasoning words in `file.txt` and expand them to a sentence about the original word.

In summary:
* `grammar_logic_to_alg.pl` - This is the mainstay algorithm that can act as a mind-mapping tool to write sentence breasonings (and is much faster for people than sitting there thinking of inspiration, crossing sentences to words or trying to write a use (at the end), the algorithm description and three steps, which I aim for, without any computer science arguments as practice).
* `cgpt_combophil_analogy.pl` - This generates 80 sentence breasonings, as connections between previous breasonings and words, for a limited number of meditators. I prefer to write my breasonings for safety, developedness and publishability.
* `./anti_moral_end_meditators.sh` - This breasons out 16k breasonings as duplicates of the 250 Quantum Box breasoning arguments for the rest of the meditators.
* Indicate 16k (16000) breasonings to be breasoned out the following midnight done by the co-op when it does them. This assumes breasonings are unique because they contain the date in them. On the first day, one should think of 80 objects' two parts or x, y and z dimensions to protect oneself, which can also aim at each meditator until the co-op breasons the breasonings out.

Notes:
* In an emergency, breason out <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Lucian-Academy/tree/main/Books">80 old sentence breasonings</a> with the date as part of each sentence to make them new. I would write 80 new sentence breasonings using GL, but inexperienced breasoners, the late and the busy, may prefer this. A sentence breasoning is any word (its object's x, y and z dimensions), NOT character breasoning from the sentence. As an alternative to thinking of objects' x, y and z dimension breasonings, one may think of the two parts that go well to make them up.
* This is not currently necessary, but if the breasonings each required algorithms, then one could use <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Philosophy">Spec to Algorithm</a>. Warning: do NOT program breasonings before the life-saving stage of writing or finding and breasoning them.
