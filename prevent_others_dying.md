# Prevent Others Dying

* From New Sales 7.77: "The salesperson decided to bulk breason out 16k breasonings and detailedly mind-read 250 algorithms and 250 breasonings using S2A per person per day instead of one high distinction to help complete the person's thoughts and adequately support them. I wrote a high distinction on the day or breasoning out a completed high distinction for a person before they might morally end, possibly using an algorithm, preventing them from ending in conjunction with meditation and being connected to the simulation via a simulant. I accessed a chatbot from VPS(s) involving the relevant costs and a way of paying to protect meditators. This process might involve some or all of the meditators. All were indebted to the person, were a joy to them and didn't appear to die".

* To prevent a meditator from appearing to die, apart from them not experiencing death, enter:

```
cd Time_Machine
swipl
['cgpt_combophil_analogy.pl'].
L = ['person a','person b'],length(L,N1),N is N1*80,cgpt_combophil(N).                                               
```

* where `['person a','person b']` is replaced with a list of meditators to watch.

* The previous command breasons out an 80-breasoning high distinction for each meditator at midnight to prevent people from dying. I would recommend running this script daily. Unfortunately, because of the time and money to run ChatGPT, it may take too long, and spot-checks may be necessary.

* This is done for all meditators automatically at the end of `Daily-Regimen/big_medit1.sh` and the much faster `Daily-Regimen/big_medit2.sh`, but running the script below once at the start covers all the meditators until midnight that night. (One doesn't need to run `cgpt_combophil_analogy.pl` apart from until midnight the first night. If one indicates 16k breasonings, one should also run `cgpt_combophil_analogy.pl`. Indicating 16k breasonings runs the risk of no protection until midnight and the first day if the co-op has already breasoned out the argument.)

```
cd Daily-Regimen
./anti_moral_end_meditators.sh
```

* One can indicate 16k breasonings for each meditator.

* The full version of the professional requirement is breasoning out 80 sentence breasonings to prevent a moral end. In addition, one should write 80 original sentence breasonings per week for maintenance.

* The best way to write 80 original sentence breasonings is to write a word to expand to 80 breasonings in `Text-to-Breasonings/file.txt`, then run:

```
cd Algorithm-Writer-with-Lists
swipl
['grammar_logic_to_alg.pl'].
grammar_logic_to_alg1.
```

* Then find the unique breasoning words in `file.txt` and expand them to a sentence about the original word.

In summary:
* `grammar_logic_to_alg.pl` - This algorithm can be a mind-mapping tool for writing sentence breasonings. GL is much faster for people than sitting there thinking of inspiration or crossing sentences to words. For the five sentences about each of the 16 algorithm topics (80 sentences), I wrote a use (at the end), the algorithm description and three steps. An algorithm is any logical set of steps, and GL is excellent for helping think of them quickly.
* `cgpt_combophil_analogy.pl` - This generates 80 sentence breasonings, as connections between previous breasonings and words, for a limited number of meditators. I prefer to write my reasoning (see `grammar_logic_to_alg.pl`) for safety, developedness and publishability.
* `./anti_moral_end_meditators.sh` - This breasons out 16k breasonings as duplicates of the 250 Quantum Box breasoning arguments for the rest of the meditators.
* Indicate 16k (16,000) breasonings to be breasoned out the following midnight breasoned by the co-op when it does them. This technique assumes breasonings are unique because they contain the breasoning number, as do all Text-to-Breasonings and Quantum Box stamp breasonings. On the first day, one should think of 80 objects' x, y and z dimensions to protect oneself, which can also aim at each meditator until the co-op breasons the breasonings out. If the co-op has already breasoned out the breasonings for the day, think of both 80 objects' or x, y and z dimensions for up to midnight and midnight on the first day.

Notes:
* In an emergency, breason out <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Lucian-Academy/tree/main/Books">80 old sentence breasonings</a> with the date as part of each sentence to make them new. I would write 80 new sentence breasonings using GL, but inexperienced breasoners, the late and the busy, may prefer this. A sentence breasoning is any word (its object's x, y and z dimensions), NOT character breasoning from the sentence.
* This is not currently necessary, but if the breasonings each required algorithms, then one could use <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Philosophy">Spec to Algorithm</a>. Warning: do NOT program breasonings before the life-saving stage of writing or finding and breasoning them.
* The system is not infallible, and the helpers sometimes get tired.
* The minimum number of required mind-read decision points of the algorithms is one decision point to 250 or more algorithms. Understanding an algorithm (by using <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/mindreader">mind-reading software</a> or collecting a comment and writing and breasoning out a word from part of a predicate based on it) is crucial for a meditator to survive.
* Understanding an algorithm is necessary for each meditator on the first day until midnight and the second day if the co-op has already breasoned the breasonings if relying on it.

* To mind_read an algorithm from each meditator, run the following algorithm.
```
swipl
['mrs2a_binary5.pl'].
mrs2a_binary5
```
* `mrs2a_binary5` is unnecessary because `big_medit*.sh` breasons out 16k arguments and algorithms per meditator. `mrs2a_binary5` and similar algorithms help engage prospective customers.
